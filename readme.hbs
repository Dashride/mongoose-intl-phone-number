This module takes a string of numbers and determines their validity as well as returns data about the phone numbers. This module is based on Google's [libphonenumber](https://github.com/mattbornski/libphonenumber).

## How it works
A phone number is provided on the document, during the pre-save/validate hook (you can specify), it runs the phone number through [libphonenumber](https://github.com/mattbornski/libphonenumber) and stores the data returned onto fields in the document model.

## Use Case
Applications that accept international phone numbers should use this plugin to gather and store information about the number such as country code, national format, etc.

## Installation

`npm install --save mongoose-intl-phone-number`
